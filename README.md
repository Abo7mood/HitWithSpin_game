# Story of this game 📖
--------------------------


I created this game as a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for one of my clients on **Fiverr**. The project was completed on **5/6/2022** as part of his vision for a 2D game.

At the time, I worked primarily as a **2D game developer**, with limited interest in multiplayer mechanics. My passion for **2D games** shaped the way I approached this project, allowing me to focus on creating a polished and engaging experience.

The development process wasn’t without its challenges. I faced a few technical hurdles and incorporated some revisions based on the client's feedback. However, I stayed committed to delivering a product that met his expectations. 

In the end, the hard work paid off. The client was thrilled with the result and left me a glowing **5-star review on Fiverr**, praising my dedication and expertise. This project remains a memorable milestone in my journey as a game developer.
